; advanced features in Latte
; ============
; inner method
; ============
class TestInnerMethod
    def outer()
        def inner()  ; a method defined inside another is `inner method`
            return 1
        return inner() ; invoke inner method
; inner methods are private and can only be accessed in the current scope
; the inner method generates a new private method inside the class,
; the method name is automatically generated and there's rare chance you would
; invoke the generated method directly instead of invoking by inner method name

; the inner method have several limitations
; 1. parameters of inner methods don't have default values
; 2. inner methods don't have annotations and modifiers
; 3. inner method cannot be overwritten

; Note That, the inner method can capture local variables,
; and can change the values `inside` the inner method,
; but it won't have effect on the outer method variables

; =========
; procedure
; =========
class TestProcedure
    def method()
        return (return 1) ; the procedure is surrounded by (),
              ; and there should be at least one statement
              ; or more than one expression in the procedure
; the procedure allow you to write code anywhere
; e.g.
; in java, we use boolValue?exp1:exp2, in Latte, we can use
; (   if boolValue
;         return exp1
;     else
;         return exp2)
; the procedure itself is considered as a Value
; so it can be filled into any position that requires a value

; the procedure is based on inner method
; it simply creates an inner method with no parameters and invokes it

; ======
; lambda
; ======
; java supports lambda for FunctionalInterfaces
; Latte not only supports that, but also supports `FunctionalAbstractClasses`
; a FunctionalAbstractClass means An abstract class with only one unimplemented
; method and it has a public constructor with no parameters
; e.g.
@FunctionalAbstractClass
abstract class Func
    abstract apply(o)=...
; Func is a FunctionalAbstractClass
; (o)->... creates a subclass
; and overrides `apply(o)`

; here's how to use
class TestLambda
    public func1:Func=(o)->o+1 ; creates an instance of Func and it adds o with 1
    public func2:java::util::function::Function=(o)->o+1 ; uses jdk LambdaMetaFactory
    public func3=(o)->o+1      ; lt::lang::function::Function1
    ; the type of the lambda is lt::lang::function::Function1
    ; there are 27 functions from Function0 to Function26
    ; taking parameters whose sizes range from 0 to 26
    public list=[1,2,3]
    list=list.stream().map(
        (v)->v.toString()
    ).collect(java::util::stream::Collectors.toList())
; lambda is based on inner method
; it creates an inner method and retreive MethodHandle of the method
; and uses LambdaMetaFactory or create a subclass at runtime
